# Secure Business Website Checklist

This checklist highlights common security risks found on small business websites and practical ways to reduce them.

The goal is not advanced hacking, but **risk awareness, prevention, and trust-building**.

---

## 1. Insecure Contact Forms
**Risk:** Spam, data leaks, injection attacks  
**Why it matters:** Contact forms are one of the most attacked parts of a website  
**Basic Fix:** Input validation, honeypots, rate limiting

---

## 2. Missing HTTPS
**Risk:** Data interception, loss of trust  
**Why it matters:** Browsers flag non-HTTPS sites as unsafe  
**Basic Fix:** SSL certificate (Let’s Encrypt)

---

## 3. Poor Input Validation
**Risk:** XSS, broken forms, malicious input  
**Why it matters:** User input is never trusted  
**Basic Fix:** Front-end + server-side validation

---

## 4. No Rate Limiting
**Risk:** Brute force, spam floods  
**Why it matters:** Automated attacks exploit unlimited requests  
**Basic Fix:** Request throttling and timing checks

---

## 5. Weak Privacy Messaging
**Risk:** Legal issues, loss of user trust  
**Why it matters:** Users want to know how their data is handled  
**Basic Fix:** Clear privacy statements

---

## 6. No Backups
**Risk:** Total data loss after attack or failure  
**Why it matters:** Recovery is impossible without backups  
**Basic Fix:** Scheduled automated backups

---

## Conclusion
Website security is not about fear — it’s about **prevention, clarity, and trust**.
